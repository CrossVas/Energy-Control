## Creating an addon

### Prerequisites

- Basic Java and Gradle knowledge
- A MinecraftForge modding environment set up

### Declaring the EnergyControl dependency

Add EnergyControl as a dependency to your project using [CurseMaven](https://www.cursemaven.com/)
For example `implementation fg.deobf('curse.maven:energy-control-51195:<fileId>')`, replacing `<fileId>` 
with the desired version's file ID (as explained on the linked website)

### Using the API

You can find the API classes in the `com.zuxelus.energycontrol.api` package. They come with Javadoc documentation
that explains their usage.
